        <h2>Primary Care</h2>
        <p>Your pets depend on you to keep them healthy, and we are here to help. Are all of their vaccinations up to date? Do you need help selecting the best flea and tick prevention products? Has your pet gained or lost weight recently, changed his or her eating habits, or just seemed a little down? Is your senior pet having any problems? Maybe everything seems fine, but we still recommend making an appointment for an annual exam. Pets need them too, just like any other member of your family. Greater Boston Humane Society's Medical Center provides more than specialty services. Our General Medicine staff will welcome you and your pet and give you the best and friendliest of care.</p>
        <p>Consistent with the reputation as a full-service veterinary hospital, members of our General Medicine staff provide primary and preventative care to our clients. Our General Medicine veterinarians have additional special professional interests such as dermatology, geriatric medicine, chronic disease, endocrinology, vaccination and preventive medicine.</p>
        <p>The Greater Boston Humane Society Medical Center is open 24 hours-a-day, every day of the year. With specialty services in Avian and Exotic Medicine, Cardiology, Dentistry, Emergency and Critical Care, Internal Medicine, Neurology, Nutrition, Oncology, Ophthalmology and Surgery, our General Medicine clinicians provide a collaborative approach to specialty care in necessary cases. In addition, with a Diagnostic Imaging Department with in-house services, including a state-of-the-art MRI and high-speed CT, our veterinarians have the ability to approach diagnosis and treatment on a paramount level.</p>
